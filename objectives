    i'll try to implement a difficulty system and a bug-catcher to prevent the program to just stop running, lets see how long that'll take.

    slightly late to comment, since i've actually already resolved the major issues from yesterday. Still, with the difficulty feature done, now its time to implement the changes to the main branch and start working on the bug-catcher.
